# Overview

We'll execute all scripts within the EC2 instance, necessitating the creation of a new EC2 instance with appropriate IAM roles. Subsequently, we'll develop a Python script to retrieve a CSV file from a URL, alongside creating a new S3 bucket and uploading the retrieved CSV file into it. Automating the entire process via a shell script will enable real-time log monitoring. This methodology could potentially extend to triggering Lambda functions or managing other operations from within the EC2 environment.
